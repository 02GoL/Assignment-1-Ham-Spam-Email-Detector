        <p>From the wiki page</p>
        <p>
          Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering.
          They typically use bag-of-words features to identify email spam, an approach
          commonly used in text classification.

          Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words,
          or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes'
          theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.

          Naive Bayes spam filtering is a baseline technique for dealing with spam that
          can tailor itself to the email needs of individual users and give low false
          positive spam detection rates that are generally acceptable to users. It is one
          of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular words have particular probabilities of occurring in spam email and
          in legitimate email. For instance, most email users will frequently encounter
          the word "Viagra" in spam email, but will seldom see it in other email. The
          filter doesn't know these probabilities in advance, and must first be trained
          so it can build them up. To train the filter, the user must manually indicate
          whether a new email is spam or not. For all words in each training email, the
          filter will adjust the probabilities that each word will appear in spam or
          legitimate email in its database. For instance, Bayesian spam filters will
          typically have learned a very high spam probability for the words "Viagra"
          and "refinance", but a very low spam probability for words seen only in
          legitimate email, such as the names of friends and family members.

          After training, the word probabilities (also known as likelihood functions)
          are used to compute the probability that an email with a particular set of
          words in it belongs to either category. Each word in the email contributes to
          the email's spam probability, or only the most interesting words. This
          contribution is called the posterior probability and is computed using Bayes'
          theorem. Then, the email's spam probability is computed over all words in the
          email, and if the total exceeds a certain threshold (say 95%), the filter will
          mark the email as a spam.

          As in any other spam filtering technique, email marked as spam can then be
          automatically moved to a "Junk" email folder, or even deleted outright. Some
          software implement quarantine mechanisms that define a time frame during
          which the user is allowed to review the software's decision.

          The initial training can usually be refined when wrong judgements from the
          software are identified (false positives or false negatives). That allows
          the software to dynamically adapt to the ever-evolving nature of spam.

          Some spam filters combine the results of both Bayesian spam filtering and
          other heuristics (pre-defined rules about the contents, looking at the
          message's envelope, etc.), resulting in even higher filtering accuracy,
          sometimes at the cost of adaptiveness.

          This was a project for CSCI 2020U Software Systems Development & Integration
          where we explored how we can filter out spam email from actual emails via
          Naives Bayer's Spam Filtering.
